Obtaining SimX
==============
The latest working version of SimX can be downloaded from the 
SimX GitHub page at
http://github.com/sim-x/simx

You can download SimX  sources as a zip file, or check it out via 
anonymous git using the following  command

git clone http://github.com/sim-x/simx.git

SimX Requirements
=================

Most of Simx is written in C++ and will have to be built from source. 
The SimX build system uses Python's setuptools along with CMake for
determining platform specific configuration parameters. In addition to
a C++ compiler and Python (>=2.4 ) you will need the the following 
packages to build SimX

- CMake (>=2.6)
- Boost C++ library ( >= 1.35)
- MPI


SimX also uses a Python package called greenlets for process oriented 
simulation; this will be automatically installed while building SimX.


Installing SimX
===============

To build and install SimX, change to the source root directory and type

python setup.py install
This will build SimX and install it to the appropriate Python site-packages
directory.

If you do not have write permissions to the system Python directories,  try:
python setup.py install --user 

This will build and install SimX under the user's home directory. Python
2.6 or higher is required for user mode installation.

By default SimX is built with the bundled SSF library 
(www.primessf.net/minissf) for message passing and synchronization. 
SimX can also be built with its own native message passing library.

For this, first build SimX using
python setup.py build --without-ssf
followed by
python setup.py install

This alternative build requires your MPI installation to be fully multi-threaded
(on the otherhand SSF can run on both single and multi-threaded MPI). 
Depending on your computational setup and simulation needs, one or the other 
might perform better.  


Using SimX
==========

See examples/HelloWorld for a simple python simulation application that uses SimX.
