Obtaining SimX
==============
The latest working version of SimX can be checked out via anonymous git

git clone http://github.com/sim-x/simx.git

Bulding SimX
============

SimX uses the CMake build system to generate the required Makefiles. 
CMake version 2.6 or higher is required.

Other requirements are

 - Python (>= 2.4) 
 - Boost C++ library ( >= 1.35)
 - MPICH2
 - gcc >= 4.2 

Once the required libraries are installed, to build SimX:

cd build
cmake ../
make

This will build the SimX shared library. If the build is succesful, you should have a 
simx.so shared library in the build directory. 

Add build to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.

See examples/HelloWorld for a simple python simulation application that uses SimX.
