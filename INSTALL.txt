To build simx:

cd build
cmake ../src

This will build the simx shared library. If the build is succesful, you should have a 
simx.so shared library in the build directory. 

Add build/ to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.

See examples/HelloWorld for a simple python simulation application that uses simx.
